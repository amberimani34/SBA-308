# SBA-308

This lab was done to take all the information of 2 learners, including their turned in assignments, grades, and due dates to create a laid out array.

This was accomplished step by step by pulling out the learner id's first and getting rid of the duplicates. Then pulling out the learner scores and matching them to points possible. Once these numbers were pulled out I was able to get average scores per assignment and add keys, and then get the entire weighted average per learner. 

These were setup to go into an array for the final result, and then the last step was to throw an error then console.log the function.
